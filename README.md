#Creative iOS Coding Lightning Talk
###Seattle Xcoders December 2016

###Motivation: Inspire iOS devs to incorporate creative iOS coding and design tools into their technical practice.

Before I became a software engineer, I was a fashion designer.

What I learned during that time in my life is that a **combined technical and creative practice is powerful**. I drafted and developed my patterns and tailored coats in addition to designing them. For me, taking what is essentially a 2D surface (fabric) and fitting it to a 3D form that is complex and dynamic (human body) was an interesting problem. Writing creative code allows me to continue this multi-disciplinary approach and take in a new direction.

A second transferable skill I gained as a fashion designer was the ability to recognize trends, which is an exercise in **visual pattern recognition**. For this talk, I demonstrate how to take inspiration from a pattern (in this case a "pineapple trend"), and apply it to a creative project (a fictitious commission from [Pineapple Supply Co.](http://pineapples.io/)) using [C4 Studio](http://c4studio.co/) Alpha.

Our fictitious Pineapple Supply Co. project manager has asked us to create a loading screen animation of the company logo for their new native iOS pineapple stock photo application. **Let's use C4 Studio!**
